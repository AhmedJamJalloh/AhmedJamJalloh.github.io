Sierra Leone, a small country that is along the West Coast of Africa. She got her name from the Portuguese Explorer Pedro Da Sintra whom
after mapping the surrounding Freetown harbor, named the formation “Serra Leoa” which means Lioness mountain in Portuguese. This small
nation is known worldwide for its 11 years Civil war which began on the 23 March 1991, its beautiful white beaches and also its wide 
variety of mineral resources.
Like most wars, it involves men who think they have a legitimate right to the “high” seat of a particular land and is often birthed from
the futile reason to earn money, power and respect. By the end of the war in 2002, millions were left displaced, thousands killed and
hundreds of thousands left with scars that would last a lifetime. Amputees and child soldiers were the most unfortunate survivors of this
awful episode of Sierra Leones history, as only few were able to successfully gel back into society.
Apart from the lives that were lost, the war also destroyed many government buildings, house, bridges and even some roads. This war ended
approximately 17 years ago, but the stains of it is still a clear evidence in the Nation today. Its economy, infrastructure and even 
educational sector has never been restored to its “pre-civil” war days.
