There has always been a misconception among common folks about the meaning and implications of Computer Hacking. The word itself
has baffled so many as to push some to assume only the negative whenever Computer hacking is mentioned. However, this is not so. 
Hacking, just like power, can be used for both good and evil. It’s very unfortunate that most people only associate hackers whenever 
hacking scandals like the UBER, EQUIFAX, BITCOIN, etc. We tend to forget the hackers who work in the public’s interest; to help detect 
and correct flaws in computer network systems and the like. This article is written to give us a deeper understanding of the meaning 
of Computer hacking, its implications and pros and cons.

### DEFINITION AND TYPES OF HACKING
“Hacking generally refers to the manipulation of a computer program, device, or system in a way unintended by its creator or owner.
People often use the term hacking to refer to certain types of criminal activity. Such activity involves “breaking into” computers or
systems by defeating electronic security measures. Not all hacking is illegal or harmful. Some hackers are driven by curiosity or a 
passion for solving puzzles. Still others hack for ideological reasons, believing in unrestricted access to information.Malicious
criminal hackers are often called crackers or black hats. Some hack for personal gain. For example, a criminal hacker may steal
financial information from banking computers. Others may seek to damage the computer networks of businesses or organizations.Hackers
considered white hats, by contrast, hack for more benign reasons. They may hack to identify security flaws and help improve computer
security. Hacking activity may be classified by the technology involved. Phreaking, for example, refers to hacking telephone systems.
Wardriving involves hacking wireless computer networks. In a broader sense, the term hacking can mean modifying anything for an
unintended use. In this sense, a hacker might modify a robotic vacuum cleaner to act as an automated sentry (guard). Similarly, a 
hacker might build a novel piece of furniture by rearranging the parts of prefabricated furniture kits. This kind of hacking shares a
strong connection with traditional tinkering.” (Funk & Wagnalls, 2017, 1p.)

### PROS AND CONS OF COMPUTER HACKING

Advantages of computer hacking can be summarized as the following:
-	Computer hacking can be used to recover lost data or information on a computer system. In fact, hackers help build computer network
  and systems.
-	This teaches us that no computer or technology is 100% secure. It builds awareness at all levels.
Disadvantages of Hacking can be summarized as follows:
-	Confidential information can be accessed for malicious reasons.


### ITS IMPLICATIONS ON SOCIETY

According to Julie Herschfeld Davis (2015) “The Obama administration on Thursday revealed that 21.5 million people were swept up in 
a colossal breach of government computer systems that was far more damaging than initially thought, resulting in the theft of a vast 
trove of personal information, including social security numbers and some fingerprints.” (para.1)
The media has recently been plagued by information of Data Interference, system interference, identity fraud and the likes. The above
example is one of many security breaches that has taken our Digital era by surprise. Not too long ago, companies like Uber, Equifax and
Bitcoin were rocked by major Data breaches that affected millions. Computer hacking has a legal implication too, as it involves the
unsolicited interference of both public and private computer systems. This has proved to be a major problem globally.

According to The Barrister Magazine UK, 2015 “A research report published by the Home Office in October 2013 concluded, based on 
statistics from global anti-virus providers, that security attacks by cyber criminals are in the billions, with numbers rising year 
after year. In the post-Snowden era, concern over online hacking and the subsequent comprising of personal data is at an all-time high.
Just recently the controversial website, Ashley Madison, was subject to a security attack of unprecedented levels, with hackers
threatening to sell the personal information of the site’s 37 million users for profit.”

In conclusion, even though we must commend white hat hackers for their role in society. Black hat hackers have made quite a negative
impression on our society. Even with laws such as the Computer Fraud and abuse act in the US and many more anti-cybercrime laws around
the world, this has failed to stop black hat hackers from preying on the masses. This has left many with many unanswered questions and
even fear of issues that may arise in the not too distance future of fast growing digital age.
