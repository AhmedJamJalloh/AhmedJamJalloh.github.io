First of many websites. This website tells you a little bit about myself;
- Where I was born
- Some of the major events in my past and present
- What kind of job I have

My name is Ahmed Tejan Jam-Jalloh. I am originally from Sierra Leone, West Africa. I basically lived there my whole life and relocated to
the United States in 2014 after my graduation from college. I lived in the United States for about six months and then decided to join the
US Navy. I joined the Navy mainly to serve and protect our countryâ€™s liberty and freedom. Other reasons for joining the Navy is School, 
travelling and apprenticeship and also because I feel like giving back to the military after what the military did for my motherland back
in the Civil war.I graduated boot camp and have been stationed in Japan since February 2016. I love what I do, I am growing both
professionally, academically and personally. Please take a moment and go through my website and for any feedback please feel free to
contact me via email or my LinkedIn link below.
